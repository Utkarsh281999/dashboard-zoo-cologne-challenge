Dashboard Zoo Cologne Challenge — With Schedule View 
Completed: April 2025

Earlier this year, I tackled a fullstack TypeScript project where I stepped in as the new “IT Director” for the Cologne Zoo (🧪 dev challenge style).

The project goal? Bring a broken dashboard back to life after a simulated malware attack — and improve it beyond its former glory.

 What I did:
🛠Repaired broken Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 + Tailwind project

 Debugged and fixed failing age calculation logic & test coverage

 Restored and improved animal data table UI

 Built a custom Monthly Food Calculator (with rules like: “double food for babies” and “0kg if fish 🐠”)

Implemented a brand new Schedule View that:

Groups animal feeding tasks by date

Shows required fruit, name, and calculated weight per animal

This was a fun challenge that brought together backend logic, frontend design, and thoughtful UX planning — plus some zoo-themed edge cases 🐍

Would love to connect with others solving quirky or complex frontend/backend problems!
